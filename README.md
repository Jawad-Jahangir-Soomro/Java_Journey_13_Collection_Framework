# Java Journey, 13: Collection Framework.

Repository 13 is focused on the Collection Framework in Java. It covers the fundamentals of collections. Through this repository, developers can gain a deeper understanding of the Collection Framework and its applications in Java programming.

## What is Java Collection?

In Java, a Collection refers to a group of objects or elements that are treated as a single unit. It is a framework of interfaces and classes that is used to store and manipulate groups of data. The Collection framework provides many predefined classes like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, etc. that can be used to store and manipulate data in various ways. With the Collection framework, you can easily perform operations like searching, sorting, inserting, deleting, and iterating over elements in a collection.

## What is Java Collection Framework?

Java Collection Framework is a pre-built architecture provided by Java for handling and manipulating groups of related objects, i.e., collections. It is a unified architecture that provides a standard way to store, manage, and manipulate collections of objects. It includes interfaces, classes, and algorithms that allow for the manipulation of collections of objects, such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeMap, HashMap, etc. The Java Collection Framework provides many benefits like code reuse, standardization, and performance improvements by providing efficient data structures and algorithms. It also simplifies the process of writing code and reduces the chances of errors.

## Collection Framework Hierarchy?

The Java Collection Framework is organized in the form of a hierarchy, with the Collection interface at the top, followed by the List, Set, and Queue interfaces. The Map interface is separate from this hierarchy.

1- Collection: This is the root interface of the collection hierarchy. It defines the basic operations that are common to all the collection types such as add(), remove(), size(), and iterator().

2- List: This is an ordered collection that allows duplicates. It provides positional access to elements using index-based methods like get(), set(), add(), and remove().

3- Set: This is an unordered collection that does not allow duplicates. It provides methods for adding, removing, and testing for the presence of elements in the set.

4- Queue: This is an ordered collection that typically stores elements in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. It provides methods like offer(), poll(), and peek() to add, remove, and access elements.

5- Map: This is a key-value pair collection that provides methods to add, remove and access elements by key. It doesn't implement the Collection interface, but it's a part of the Collection Framework.

Collection Framework will be perfectly Understandable in Data Structures and Algorithms.
